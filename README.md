Pycharm Tips
1.	Pycharm is a java program, it cost much more memory, and need more time to start up. But after start up, it runs fast.

2.	One difference between community edition and professional edition. Professional edition support css/qss file well, so you will have a color picker when you write the color code (we won’t write css but we will need to write qss file when doing QT dev ).  It’s  a free function in VSCode with a plugin.

3.	You can set up everything in the Settings panel, include editor setting and project setting. You will not need to write in any json files to config anything.

4.	Manage interpreters, library path and packages in Project/Python Interpreter.

5.	Sometimes, your project path is not your python library path, right click the directory and mark is as Source Root.

6.	Rename/Move a file. To Pycharm, these kind of operations are Refactor. When you rename a file, Pycharm will modify your code with new name automatically. For ex: I renamed “item_pane” to “oooooooooo_pane”, you can see Pycharm modifid the code automatically for me. Also, if you move a file to another folder, Pycharm will also track this file, and modify your code automatically. So basically, whenever you want to rename files or adjust file structure, you can just do it. (In some cases, if the project is super complex, the “Refactor” may failed).

7.	 Docstring by three “”” and enter.  If it doesn’t work, set it here.
